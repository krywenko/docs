## How to use it?

First of all, you need to install the npm package in your netbeast app

 Once the package is in the node_modules folder, you can require it from the code. You are able to require all the methods or only some specific areas.

```javascript
//  Option 1 - the whole netbeast API wrapper
var nb = require('netbeast')

nb.resources('lights').get()

//  Option 2 â€“ directly only of those functions needed
var resources = require('netbeast').resources
var scene = require('netbeast').scene
var devices = require('netbeast').devices

resources('lights').get()
```
